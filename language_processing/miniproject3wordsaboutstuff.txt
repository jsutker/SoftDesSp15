I used Project Gutenberg to find the text for Jekyll and Hyde. In order to fulfill my goals for this project, I found the longest word, then sorted the words by number of appearances. I wanted to see if the specific wording of the book reflected its messages.

In the beginning, I read the text from the file I downloaded, then decided to filter it into a list of the words. I then took the words, and discovered what the longest word is (for fun). After that, I created a nested list of each word that appears and the number of times it appears. The function then neatly prints out the longest word and the number of times each of the 50 most seen words appear.

One thing that I found to be interesting was the order in which the character names appeared on this list. Utterson (#27) appeared more times than Hyde (#35), who appeared more times than his counterpart Jekyll (#38). Another fun thing is that the word "lawyer" showed up 67 times at #50.

I feel that the overall process went well, but I felt that if I was able to think of a more complex analysis to perform, the results would have been significantly more interesting. Tests were performed at 3 logical points before proceeding to the next section: after the longest word was found, after the word count list (wcList) was created, and after the word count list was arranged by the count (mostWordList). Going forward, I will attempt to find a better scoped topic to work on, and I will not wait until the last minute to actually decide on the topic. I wish I had known some projects that people had done in the past so that I could have had an easier time of coming up with ideas by playing off of their ideas.
